Crash course programming December 9th 
 <br><br>There was one issue constantly coming back when programming my portfolio, the picture’s and text’s formatting was wrong almost halve of the time. I had already asked a classmate for help, but he did not know what the mistake was. I needed help from someone with programming experience to show me some tricks, and to hopefully help me with the issue. 
 <br><br>I asked Hubert Bessems, a college at Maastro with programming experience, if he could teach me some tips and tricks, and most importantly, if he knew why my picture formatting was acting strange. I learned a lot from him. First, he looked at my code and, in that instance, he could not find why there were big gaps in between text and pictures. Then he showed me something that changed everything; to press f12. I remember using that in high school, but I totally forgot about it. This button makes you able to analyze websites and to see their code. By holding the cursor on my picture, I could see which parts of code were involved in that certain area. Unfortunately, we could not find the mistake, however, learning about this function can help me a lot in the future. You can look at other websites, and if you like something from there, you just look at the code. Except for that, and most importantly, it makes it easier to analyze my own code when something is not going the way I planned.
 <br><br>Another helpful trick Hubert taught me is the edit and replace function. As I write most of my text in word, and later copy it to Visual Studio Code, it does not consider line breaks. For every break you want, you must put <br> behind the sentence. It took a lot of time to include this everywhere. He showed me that by pressing CMD+OPT+F, you can change one input in your whole code. For example, to include breaks, I later press CMD+OPT+R, and then change \n to \n<br>. Knowing this will save me so much time, and the code will be less of a mess.
 <br><br>Unfortunately, Hubert was not able to help me with the picture issue itself. However, this evening I spend much time on programming, and on using his tricks to change and to analyze my code, and I finally found a method to fix it. I included an extra line of code in every “picture-container”, specifying the width the picture box can have, fixing the mistake.
 <br><br>I am glad I asked Hubert for help. You can see that even though he did not find the problem, he still gave me knowledge to find the problem myself. I am happy that I asked him to help, and I believe my future code will be better. I will use his tips and tricks a lot during these next weeks.
