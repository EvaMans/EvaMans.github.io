SQL workshop 
To refresh my basics of SQL, I worked through the slides that Pepa made for his workshop for PhD students. I appreciated how he clearly explained everything, the structure, the commands as “SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, & GROUP BY”, and the logic behind how databases are queried. Furthermore, I liked how interactive the slides were, even though I was only going through them on my own, they still showed me the steps of what to do. While going through the material on my own, I ran into a few things I struggled with. Luckily, Pepa told me I could always asked questions when I ran into troubles. He explained my challenges in an approachable way, which helped me to keep going and to not feel intimidated by all the commands.
<br><br>His lecture slides gave me insights into how SQL can be used to analyze data, something I might need to do in the future. It can be helpful to understand how patient records or treatment outcomes can be analyzed using simple queries, and how SQL fits into the broader world of data-driven decision-making. 
<br><br>Before going through the slides, I thought SQL would be much harder, but working through them at my own pace, and being able to ask Pepa for clarification when needed, made the difference. It showed me that with the right resources and support, I can keep improving my technical skills. I am grateful I could use his workshop to learn from myself.
