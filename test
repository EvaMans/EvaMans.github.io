                    <p> My name is Eva Mans, and I am 21 years old, born and raised in a small town called Valkenburg,
                        Netherlands. Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Health and Digital Transformation,
                        where I combine my passion for healthcare and technology. Since September, I have been applying
                        my knowledge in practice at Maastro, gaining valuable hands-on experience. Alongside my studies,
                        I occasionally help out at the restaurant where I worked for six years, a place that will always
                        have beautiful memories for me. <br><br>
                        Outside of work and academics, I have a variety of interests. I enjoy staying active, whether it
                        is through sports, spending time with friends, cooking, or traveling. My favorite sport is padel
                        because it is energetic, social, and always played with others. I also enjoy trying new
                        activities at UM Sports and running through nature to clear my mind.

                    Whenever I have a few days off, you can often find me exploring new destinations. Whether it is a
                    quick trip across the border to Belgium or a journey to the other side of the globe, I love
                    experiencing new cities, nature, and cultures. Some of my most memorable adventures have been in
                    South Africa and Sri Lanka, two incredibly diverse countries offering vibrant cityscapes and
                    stunning wildlife. I believe traveling is more than just a leisure activity; it is an opportunity to
                    personally grow, gain new perspectives, and connect with people from all around the world.</div>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>I am currently involved in an interdisciplinary project called Maastricht Medication Datalink,
                        which focuses on finding ways to prevent prescribing cascades. This project takes place at
                        MUMC+, where our team of four fellow students collaborates every Wednesday to achieve our shared
                        goal: creating a digital tool to prevent prescribing cascades. A prescribing cascade occurs when
                        a drug causes an adverse reaction, leading to the prescription of additional drugs to address
                        the side effects.
                        <br><br> In the first phase of the project, we focus on understanding prescribing cascades and
                        conducting research on Prescription Sequence Symmetry Analysis (PSSA). Moving into the second
                        phase, we will analyze a dataset using Python to identify common cascades. Ultimately, the aim
                        is to program a tool that can detect cascades automatically and alert prescribers via a pop-up
                        notification. However, we are aware that this goal may be ambitious given the project’s
                        timeframe.
                        <br><br>The project is both challenging and rewarding. Before this, I was unaware of the concept
                        of prescribing cascades, but I have come to realize that they represent a significant issue in
                        healthcare. Addressing this problem could improve patient outcomes and help reduce healthcare
                        costs.
                        <br><br>What excites me most about this project is its real-world relevance. The tool we are
                        developing has the potential to be implemented in the hospital, making our work directly
                        impactful. I am hopeful about our progress, as we have a dedicated team and an exceptionally
                        supportive external coach. While our goals are ambitious, the combination of hard work and
                        guidance gives me confidence in the project’s success.

                    <h2>Why Health and Digital Transformation?</h2>
                    <p>Data science and computer programming is something that has always intrigued me. During high
                        school I went to programming classes with excitement, and I chose to focus my graduation project
                        on this course. Together with a friend I programmed an interactive quiz website where people
                        could answer questions, see their own and each other’s progress and could also suggest new
                        questions. My friend was mostly doing the design, and I was doing most of the technical part.
                        After choosing International Business over Data Science for a bachelor, I still wanted to do
                        something with data science for my masters.

                <div class="text-content">Additionally to the technical part, with my mom working in home care, my
                    sister in the hospital and my dad in MedTech companies, my interest in healthcare also rose. My goal
                    was to end up at Medtronic, however, how I ended up there was not clear to me. One option was to
                    study supply chain management for my master and start working in the operational department, and the
                    other option was to study data science and start in the IT. For me both masters were interesting,
                    and both had futures with enough supply. However, after talking about my thesis with a friend
                    another option was added, she mentioned the new master Health and Digital Transformation which
                    perfectly aligned with my thesis. I wrote my thesis about analyzing the impact of predictive and
                    descriptive analytics on healthcare supply chain operational efficiency. It included both the data
                    science and healthcare part of this master. After doing some research about this master I was
                    immediately sold. </div>

                <div class="text-content">Combining data science and healthcare felt like the perfect path forward. This
                    field allows me to bridge my technical interests with my connection to healthcare, and my passion
                    for making an impact in this critical sector. The Health and Digital Transformation program brought
                    together all I had been looking for, a place where data-driven solutions could improve healthcare
                    efficiency, quality, and accessibility. This unique combination of disciplines not only aligned with
                    my thesis research, but also with my broader career aspirations. It is a path that lets me blend
                    analytics, technology and healthcare to help create tangible, positive change. Except for the
                    interesting courses, I was also intrigued by the set-up of the program. I liked that the program
                    does an interdisciplinary project, in which you can bring your knowledge to reality. </div>

                    <p>My learning journey has experienced many ups and downs over the years. I was the kind of child
                        who started reading books at the age of five but grew to dislike reading when it became a
                        mandatory part of schoolwork at six. I loved subjects involving calculations during primary
                        school, but it was evident from my grades that courses such as vocabulary and reading
                        comprehension were not my strengths. On the other hand, I excelled in numerical courses and was
                        even given the opportunity to work on extra assignments like “Rekentijger,” which I thoroughly
                        enjoyed.
                        <br><br>Despite my struggles with language-based courses, there was uncertainty about whether I
                        should pursue the VWO track or the HAVO track. My parents believed that HAVO would be too easy
                        for me and persuaded my teacher to recommend VWO. During high school, I was never among the
                        top-performing students. I did what was required but rarely went beyond that. While I
                        encountered my share of fails, I was always able to compensate and maintain balance in my
                        grades. I had a natural affinity for mathematics, which influenced my decision to choose the N&T
                        (Nature and Technology) package, even though my mentor discouraged me from taking a
                        science-oriented path. However, I followed my instincts and found that I performed better in
                        numerical subjects while having little interest in theoretical ones.

                    expected my grades to hover around a 6, but I graduated with an average of 7.91. The courses at
                    university were far more engaging to me than those in high school, which significantly boosted my
                    motivation. Another reason why this improvement might be, is due to the independence in university,
                    not “wasting” time by listening to the teachers in high school, as I perform better by figuring out
                    methods or solutions myself, and talk them over afterwards with a teacher. I aim to carry this
                    motivation into my master's program, striving to maintain strong grades and, ideally, graduate
                    university without needing to take any resits.</div>

                    <h4>Big Five Personality Test</h4>
                    During the first week of university, we had to do a personality test about the Big Five
                    Personalities. The outcome surprised me in some bits and made sense to me in others. The fact that
                    openness to experience was only 7% surprised me the most. I am usually a very spontaneous person
                    wanting to explore new experiences. Additionally, I do embrace change and new ideas. However, when I
                    read the explanation a bit better it said that a low openness to experience implies that you work
                    systematically and logically, and I can find myself back in that. For conscientiousness I can find
                    myself back in my score. It is a medium to high score, implying that I am more into structured
                    working, I am a hard worker, and I prepare strategies to optimize my work. My highest score is on
                    extraversion, a score which I agree with. I like to work alone and not talk to anyone often, but
                    overall, I am an extrovert who likes to work in teams. In agreeableness I score in the exact middle.
                    I would expect this to be around 10% higher, because I am more into collaborating with team members
                    then I am more into my own ideas. Lastly for natural reactions I score very low with only 13%. I
                    agree with this, as the only moment that I am stressed is when I must catch a train, however in
                    school or work environments I will always be very calm, despite of the high pressure.

                    During the second design thinking and co-creation workshop we had to do another personality test and
                    compare the results with our interdisciplinary groups. The nine different sections can be grouped
                    into three main sections: thinker, action, and social. Ideally in one group you would have at least
                    one person of each category. I scored equally high in social and in action. The social person is
                    needed for getting the group together and leading, and an actionable person is necessary for
                    performing the tasks. I scored very low in thinker, which makes sense to me because I am not an
                    inventor. Unfortunately, in our group we had no thinkers at all. All four of us scored high on
                    social, and me and another groupmate also scored equally high on action. </p>

            <h4>Change in tests</h4>

            I was interested in seeing the change I have made as a person during my Master. Therefore, I decided
            to retake the personality tests and compare the results from the beginning of the master and now.
            <div class="content-container">
                <div class="text-content">
                    <h4>Big Five Personality Test</h4>
                    For the Big Five personality test I was surprised with my first results, and I wrote down
                    what I had
                    predicted the results would be in the first period. I was surprised by openness to experience, in
                    which I
                    only scored 7%, now I have a score of 27% in which I can find myself better. I can imagine that our
                    master’s
                    program lets you think more positive about change. For consciousness, I have an increase of 20%. The
                    test
                    said that a high score means you are a workaholic, which I absolutely am. I was already a hard
                    worker before
                    my master’s program with the hours I worked next to my studies, but this year I work even more, plus
                    I work
                    harder and more on my master then I used to do on my bachelor. I am afraid I am always going to be a
                    workaholic, as I cannot handle not working. I agree with this change. Then, for extraversion there
                    is only
                    little change, but it was already very high in the previous period. Agreeableness also barely
                    changed, in
                    period one I thought this value would be 10% higher than it was, and it now increased with 3%
                    compared to
                    then. Lastly, my natural reactions have decreased even more compared to the first time I performed
                    the test.
                    I still agree with the fact that I do not really experience stress, but when looking for my
                    internship at
                    Medtronic I surely experienced some stress, more than I am used to. Therefore, I might have expected
                    this
                    value to increase a bit instead of decrease. However, overall I can see how this year in which I did
                    my
                    master and in which I started working in a relevant job has changed me, and I think the test mirrors
                    this
                    feeling well.

                    The second personality test that we did in period one gave us an overview of our role in a group. My
                    role
                    changed only slightly with chairperson increasing, implying I take the leadership role upon me even
                    more,
                    and completer and expert decreased, but they already used to be low. Contrary to the Big Five
                    Personality
                    test, according to the 123test I only changed slightly during this period. These minor changes are
                    not
                    substantial, and I am happy with the results. I also did not expect major changes.

                            science, in which we programmed in several applications, including HTML. During university,
                            I stopped programming, and I lost this skill. However, I miss it and am interested in
                            refreshing these skills. In addition to HTML, I also want to learn different programming
                            languages, like Python. This learning goal aligns perfectly with my interdisciplinary
                            project, in which we are creating a digital tool to detect prescribing cascades.<br>

                            This goal is chosen because I noticed I am inefficient in summarizing. In general, it takes
                            me very long to read an article, as I find it difficult to distinguish between important and
                            unimportant information, making summarizing also more time intensive and difficult. I
                            realize that my summaries are often much longer than fellow students’ summaries. Due to that
                            reason, I stopped making my own summaries and “wasting” time, and I used the summaries of
                            fellow students. However, I also realize that this is too easy, I should not avoid my
                            problems, I should work on them. Therefore, I thought it would be a valuable learning goal
                            to work on this. To make this goal more specific, I decided to focus the summaries on
                            prescribing cascades and PSSA, relating to the interdisciplinary project.<br>

                            groups; however, in larger (unfamiliar) groups, I hesitate to speak up. Especially with the
                            problem-based learning at UM, in more talkative groups, I noticed this problem. I am
                            sometimes afraid to speak up, because I know others will want to talk at the same time. The
                            opposite is when it is quiet in class, and then I would be the first person to speak up. I
                            do not feel comfortable in neither situation, so I decided I need to work on this. As I feel
                            truly pleasant in our classes during this master and I dare to speak up around them, I
                            decided to work on this learning goal at my work. Especially in professional environments,
                            it is so important to speak up and make people hear you. I believe it is extremely important
                            to work on being seen more in professional groups.<br>

                            The last learning goal originates from my past. I have connected with quite some
                            professionals, as this was always motivated to do so by my previous business school.
                            However, the connections that I have achieved in the past are mostly in accounting, finance,
                            supply chain, etc. As my future goal is to work at a healthcare company, I believe that I
                            need to expand my professional network, including healthcare professionals.<br>

                    <h3>Session 1</h3>
                    <p>In preparation for the first coach meeting, I prepared my SMART learning goals, and I did the
                        Five personality test. During the meeting we mostly discussed my goals. Contrary to my thoughts,
                        I learned that the goals did not necessarily have to connect with the interdisciplinary project.
                        My expert and investigator goals only needed slight changing, however we concluded I would need
                        to change the communicator and professional role a bit more extensive. I wrote down Joost’s
                        feedback and worked on my goals later to change them. My main changes are that I related my new
                        goals to my work at Maastro. After the adaptations I was more satisfied with my learning goals.
                        <br><br>
                        We only talked about the personality test very shortly as time was over.

                    <p>For the next session we would discuss the progress on my portfolio. The preparation for this
                        session was only sending the portfolio to the coach so he could prepare. I was not too happy
                        with what I delivered, as I hoped to have done a bit more on my second learning goal before this
                        meeting. However, due to personal circumstances this week, I was unable to. The first learning
                        goal will mostly be focused on in the second and fourth period, and the third and fourth goal I
                        had been working on for a while already. Luckily the coach was happy with my progress so far, so
                        it was a positive meeting. He was able to give me a few more tips on how I could tackle the
                        first two learning goals, and he was able to answer some questions I still had regarding the
                        portfolio and the master thesis.</p>

                    <h3>Session 3</h3>
                    <p>After the first period, we submitted the first part of our portfolios. In the same week, we had a
                        coach meeting to discuss where we are. The preparation for this coach meeting was only finishing
                        the portfolio for period one. The most important aspect that we talked about is that we have to
                        set five concrete deadlines for the upcoming five weeks, to make sure we work on our project
                        every week when my coach is on holiday. I believe that this is a good way to work on our goals
                        and to make sure that we do what we should do. The goals that I set are:<br>
                    <p style="margin-left:60px;">- Week 1: Summarize a PSSA article<br>
                        - Week 2: Participate in Maastricht Business Days<br>
                        - Week 3: Learn to program for the interdisciplinary project<br>
                        - Week 4: Find someone from senior staff to talk with<br>
                        - Week 5: Summarize another relevant article<br></p>
                    Furthermore, I had a question about evidence: how should I prove I talked with a care professional?
                    Because asking for a signature can seem a bit weird. Joost told me an example of evidence could be
                    to include a transcript. As I try to make my professional conversations a bit more relaxed, thus
                    without a computer to write down all that is being said, I am still unsure how I need to handle the
                    evidence for this learning goal.</p>

                    <p>Session 4 was an incredibly short coach meeting. The meeting was planned during exam week. We
                        talked about how the last period went, when my coach was on holidays, and how I am doing in
                        general. I am doing well, and I believe working on my portfolio also went well this period. I
                        told my coach about my journey in finding my own internship these past few weeks, and he
                        commented on that. There was not much more to discuss, so we finished the meeting after ten
                        minutes. </p>

                    <h3>Session 5</h3>
                    <p>During the first individual coach meeting of period 4, we discussed the portfolio I handed in in
                        period 2. Before the meeting, I read through the feedback my coach gave me. He was quite
                        enthusiastic and wrote that I should keep going the way I am going, but reflect still a little
                        more than I do now. Then during the meeting we discussed this, and we finished quite fast. He
                        gave me
                        a useful tip; that I could ask feedback for my communicator competency from my colleagues at
                        Maastro, so they can reflect on the change of my skills in these past few months. I will take
                        this feedback into account and I plan to create a document with some questions, and have some
                        peers fill this in for me. I think it is a relevant method to reflect on my communication
                        skills, as my opinion might be biased. I believe they can tell best on the change that I have
                        made during my period at Maastro.

            <h3>Goal: Improve my data science and IT techniques</h3>
            <p>In the first period there was limited time planned to improve my data science and IT techniques. However,
                each Friday we have python classes to learn the base of programming, including a group assignment in
                which we must analyze a data set and answer our own learning goals. Furthermore, I downloaded GitHub, a
                program my group member, Pepa, has introduced me to. After downloading it I started to get to know more
                about it, so in the next period when we must use it, I am familiar with the program. In the second and
                fourth period I will spend more time on this learning goal.<br></p>

                    <h4>Data literacy</h4>
                    <p>To strengthen my IT capabilities, I completed a digital course in data literacy through
                        GoodHabitz. While the course was not directly related to prescribing cascades, it provided
                        valuable insights into data science fundamentals. It covered topics such as the benefits of data
                        literacy, data definitions, processing, analysis, and quality assessment, including identifying
                        limitations and biases. It also delved into data visualization and the implications of Big Data
                        in decision-making. The course employed a structured approach, beginning with reading materials,
                        followed by knowledge-testing questions, and concluding with an exam. This course has equipped
                        me with essential skills that will support my interdisciplinary project, particularly as I’ll be
                        working extensively with data. Additionally, the course has provided me with a stronger
                        foundation concerning data science, benefitting my data science and IT techniques. <br></p>

            <h4>Portfolio</h4>
            <p>I spent more time on this learning goal than planned in this period. I decided I wanted to program my
                portfolio to create a website. This step is not directly related to the explanation of my SMART goal, as
                the goal was focused on PSSA and python. However the overall goal is to improve my data science and IT
                techniques, which this portfolio is really helping me to do. I am programming the portfolio in HTML.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>Period 2</h2>
            <h4>Portfolio</h4>
            <p>During period 1, I successfully used a webspace as my server to program my portfolio. This webspace
                offered several benefits, such as the ability to upload documents and pictures directly to the server,
                enabling seamless work across multiple devices. Previously, I had encountered issues where pictures
                included in my programming were not recognized when switching devices. Fortunately, this webspace
                resolved those challenges and functioned without issues during the first period.
                <br><br> However, as I expanded my portfolio during period 2 with additional content and proof, the
                webspace's storage capacity became a limitation. It no longer allowed me to upload new pictures, which
                are critical to showcasing my portfolio effectively. This prompted me to explore alternative options for
                programming.
                <br><br>I reached out to a fellow student experienced in programming for recommendations in servers. He
                kindly offered to help and suggested we would look at it together at school. During our discussion, he
                recommended switching to Visual Studio as a programming environment, combined with GitHub for version
                control. While I was familiar with Visual Studio from our interdisciplinary project, I had not used it
                much. He also provided a helpful explanation about GitHub, emphasizing its value for storing and
                managing changes.
                <br><br>Reflecting on this experience, I am glad I looked for advice rather than relying solely on
                online searches. Transitioning to Visual Studio has been a positive change, offering unlimited storage
                and a smooth programming experience. Using GitHub has proven to be even more insightful. Recently, I
                made a mistake while including pictures, which disrupted my site's layout. Without a clear record of
                changes, it took hours to identify and fix the issue. Going forward, GitHub will be invaluable in
                preventing such setbacks by allowing me to track and revert changes efficiently. This problem has showed
                me the importance of using the right tools and seeking for guidance when needed.

            <h4>Crash course programming December 9th </h4>
            <p>There was one issue constantly coming back when programming my portfolio, the picture’s and text’s
                formatting was wrong almost halve of the time. I had already asked a classmate for help, but he did not
                know what the mistake was. I needed help from someone with programming experience to show me some
                tricks, and to hopefully help me with the issue.
            <div class="content-container">
                <div style="width:30%; margin-right: 5%;"> <img src="Hubert.png" alt="proof"
                        style="width:100%;float:right;"></div>
                <div class="text-content">I asked Hubert Bessems, a college at Maastro with programming
                    experience, if he could teach me some tips and tricks, and most importantly, if he knew why my
                    picture formatting was acting strange. I learned a lot from him. First, he looked at my code and, in
                    that instance, he could not find why there were big gaps in between text and pictures. Then he
                    showed me something that changed everything; to press f12. I remember using that in high school, but
                    I totally forgot about it. This button makes you able to analyze websites and to see their code. By
                    holding the cursor on my picture, I could see which parts of code were involved in that certain
                    area. Unfortunately, we could not find the mistake, however, learning about this function can help
                    me a lot in the future. You can look at other websites, and if you like something from there, you
                    just look at the code. Except for that, and most importantly, it makes it easier to analyze my own
                    code when something is not going the way I planned.
                    <br><br>Another helpful trick Hubert taught me is the edit and replace function. As I write most of
                    my text in word, and later copy it to Visual Studio Code, it does not consider line breaks. For
                    every break you want, you must put &lt;br&gt; behind the sentence. It took a lot of time to include
                    this everywhere. He showed me that by pressing CMD+OPT+F, you can change one input in your whole
                    code. For example, to include breaks, I later press CMD+OPT+R, and then change \n to \n&lt;br&gt;.
                    Knowing this will save me so much time, and the code will be less of a mess.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            Unfortunately, Hubert was not able to help me with the picture issue itself. However, this evening I
            spend much time on programming, and on using his tricks to change and to analyze my code, and I finally
            found a method to fix it. I included an extra line of code in every “picture-container”, specifying the
            width the picture box can have, fixing the mistake.
            <br><br>I am glad I asked Hubert for help. You can see that even though he did not find the problem, he
            still gave me knowledge to find the problem myself. I am happy that I asked him to help, and I believe my
            future code will be better. I will use his tips and tricks a lot during these next weeks.

                    <h4>Computational thinking course</h4>
                    <p>With exams in machine learning and AI algorithms coming up, I felt the need to take a course in
                        computer science. I chose the course computational thinking from GoodHabitz, which focusses on
                        problem solving using fundamental concepts from computer science. During our technical course, I
                        realized I lacked background knowledge in certain fields. One example is that I was not able to
                        differentiate between coding and programming, a small difference which I should know in my line
                        of work.
                        <br><br>The course started with a quiz to test my background knowledge, in which I performed
                        under average. Then the set-up was split into five different categories, ending of with a final
                        exam. Each category taught valuable lessons to think as a computer scientist. The starting quiz
                        was extremely relevant to the exam from next Friday, unfortunately, the following topics were a
                        bit less relevant to what I had hoped. I still learned valuable lessons; however, I would have
                        hoped it was more about programming than it was about problem solving. I liked how the course
                        used a lot of real-life examples, as how we are using computational thinking throughout the
                        whole day, like when baking. Also, at the end of every topic a recap and a sub-quiz was given to
                        test our knowledge before going to the actual exam.

            <h4>PSSA</h4>
            <p> When receiving our interdisciplinary project and creating our learning goals, I had hoped to take part
                in the PSSA analysis. As I was one of the two people with programming experience, I also thought I would
                do part of the analysis. Unfortunately, I was not the only one with the learning goal to learn this. As
                one of my other learning goals is to connect with healthcare professionals, and the group work forced us
                to split up into two people doing PSSA, and two the interviews, I was assigned to the interview group.
                Essentially, I do not mind this, as I have never done interviews before, so I like to learn this.
                However, for this learning goal I hoped to be in the other group.
                <br><br>As choices had to be made, I accepted that I must do the qualitative work. However, I still
                wanted to be involved in what the other group was doing. I asked for updates on their side quite often,
                and when they were stuck, I tried to help. My help was mostly in giving them formulas they can use for
                solving the problem we want. Also, I joined every meeting they had with our coach. I am glad that I did,
                because even though I am not the one who is coding, I still tried to learn a lot about the PSSA.
                <br><br>PS. My recent course helped me understand the difference between coding and programming—happy to
                say I got it right this time! 😉

            <h4>Article 1</h4>
            <p><img src="article1.png" alt="article" style="width:40%;margin-left:15px;float:right;">
            <p>The first article to summarize is called “Adverse events with use of antiepileptic drugs: a prescription
                and event symmetry analysis”. I chose it to get to know a bit more about prescription and event symmetry
                analysis.</p>
            <i>Authorship:</i> The article is authored by Ioannis Tsiropoulos, Morten Andersen, and Jesper Hallas, who
            are established researchers in neurology and public health, affiliated with the University of Southern
            Denmark. Their academic background and contributions ensure integrity.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Credibility:</i> Published in Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety, a peer-reviewed journal known for
                its diligent studies, the article holds significant credibility. The inclusion of sequence symmetry

            <p>
                <i>Relevance:</i> The article is focusing on adverse drug events, especially in antiepileptic drugs. The
                article is relevant to my research on prescribing cascades, as it provides both known and unrecognized
                adverse events that could lead to cascades. Their study methods can help me inform strategies for
                recognizing prescribing cascades. However, the article was less about prescription sequence symmetry
                analysis (PSSA) than I thought it would be. Reading the article was not irrelevant, however I could have
                chosen a better article for my research.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Summary:</i> The article highlights the value of post-marketing surveillance for identifying uncommon
                adverse drug effects and displays the goal of sequence symmetry analysis by revealing both known and
                unknown drug interactions. The article supports the need for reliable methods in drug prescribing
                research, contributing to our research on identifying prescription cascades.<br><br>

            <p>The second article I chose to summarize is called “Evaluating the Use of Prescription Sequence Symmetry
                Analysis as a Pharmacovigilance Tool: A Scoping Review” written by E. J. Morris, J. Hollmann, A. K.
                Hofer, H. Bhagwandass, R. Oueini, L. E. Adkins, and S. M. Vouri. I chose this article to deepen my
                understanding of PSSA, and its application in pharmacovigilance.</p>
            <i>Authorship:</i> The article is written by a collaborative team of researchers and pharmacovigilance
            experts from various institutions. The author who led this group is E.J. Morris, who has expertise in PSSA
            and drug safety. Their combined backgrounds contribute in the significant authorship to the article.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Credibility:</i> The paper is published in Research in Social and Administrative Pharmacy, a
                well-regarded peer-reviewed journal known for its focus on pharmacy and healthcare research, providing
                this article strong credibility. Its comprehensive scoping review provides a reliable synthesis of
                previous studies on using PSSA as a tool in monitoring adverse drug reactions.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Relevance:</i> With its in-depth look at PSSA, this article was highly relevant to my
                interdisciplinary project. By analyzing the utility of PSSA in adverse drug reaction detections, or
                prescribing cascades, the article offers valuable insight into effective strategies for prescribing
                cascade prevention. <br>
            <p>
                <i>Summary:</i> The paper systematically reviews the application of PSSA in pharmacovigilance,
                evaluating its effectiveness for adverse drug reaction detection and sequence analysis. It is concluded
                that while PSSA could potentially be a valuable tool for early prescribing cascade detection, further
                studies are necessary to refine its implementation in reality. The article aligns with my research on
                the role of PSSA in detecting prescribing cascades, and it made me better understand its use and
                limitations.<br><br>

            <p><img src="article3.png" alt="article" style="width:40%;margin-left:15px;float:right;">
            <p>The reason for choosing the article “What Is Known About Preventing, Detecting, and Reversing Prescribing
                Cascades: A Scoping Review” by Brath et al. is because this period of the interdisciplinary project, we
                are focusing on detecting prescribing cascades. Therefore, I thought it would be relevant to pick an
                article that mentions some of the most commonly found cascades yet.</p>
            <i>Authorship:</i> The article is authored by experts in geriatrics and pharmacology, ensuring a strong
            foundation in the subject matter. The main author is Dee Mangin, an authority in geriatric medicine and
            pharmacovigilance.<br>

                <i>Credibility:</i> The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, where the article has been
                published, is a leading peer-reviewed journal in geriatrics, the study is highly credible, reflecting
                rigorous standards and impactful research.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Relevance:</i> The article focusses on prescribing cascades, and their prevention in older adults.
                This is directly related to my interdisciplinary project, offering insights into both the risks and
                interventions in healthcare practices. As this period is focusing on actually detecting prescribing
                cascades, this article is highly relevant for me.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Summary:</i> Multiple prescribing cascades are discussed in this article. They mention that this
                phenomenon is a significant contributor to polypharmacy in older adults, exacerbating their
                vulnerability to drug-related harm. The authors emphasize the need for clinicians to recognize the signs
                of prescribing cascades and propose systematic strategies to prevent them. Examples are enhanced
                monitoring, patient education, and interdisciplinary approaches. The study underscores the critical role
                of prescribing in improving medication safety and reducing unnecessary polypharmacy. By identifying gaps
                in clinical awareness and offering practical solutions, valuable insights for mitigating risks
                associated with complex medication regimens, aligning closely with efforts to address prescribing
                cascades in healthcare. <br><br>
            <p>What I like about this article is that it emphasizes how to detect a prescribing cascade, and it includes
                some statistical tests to make it even more credible. However, when picking this article, I had hoped to
                find a list or short summary with examples of some common prescribing cascades.</p>

            <h4>Reflection</h4>
            <p>By summarizing these articles, I have realized there is room for improvement in selecting relevant
                sources. Of the three articles that I have reviewed, two fell short of my expectations in relevance, or
                lack the lists or summaries of prescribing cascade examples that I was specifically hoping to find. This
                has highlighted the importance of thoroughly assessing an article’s alignment with my research
                objectives before investing time in analysis. I plan to refine my selection criteria, focusing more on
                abstracts, keywords, and the specific methodologies described, before starting to summarize the article.
                This reflection serves as a valuable lesson for optimizing my approach and ensuring future efforts yield
                more meaningful insights, being more relevant to my project. </p>

            <p>This week is the first week that we are planning on performing PSSA. Therefore, I tried to find an
                article that has a step-by-step guide on how to do PSSA. As a group, we all found, apart from each
                other, the same article. I will take this as a sign that we all picked a good one.</p>
            <i>Authorship:</i> Ioannis Tsiropoulos, Morten Andersen, and Jesper Hallas are the authors of this article.
            Being professionals with expertise in clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, and drug safety, their extensive
            backgrounds make their research credible and reliable for analyzing prescribing cascades through novel

            <p><img src="article5.png" alt="article" style="width:40%;margin-left:15px;float:right;">
            <p>The goal when looking for the previous article about prescribing cascades (article 3) was to find a list
                of examples. Even though the article was highly relevant, it did not mention cascades that have been
                discovered. Therefore, I am still looking for articles bringing me more knowledge about the more common
                prescribing cascades. It looks like the article “Prescribing Cascades with Recommendations to Prevent or
                Reverse Them: A Systematic Review” by Oriane Adrien et al. will provide me with that.</p>
            <i>Authorship:</i> The article is written by Oriane Adrien and eleven of her colleagues, all experts in
            pharmacology, drug safety, and geriatrics, bringing significant credibility to the findings.<br>
            <p>

                methodology used in the study ensures high credibility, with the authors applying rigorous search
                strategies and adherence to PRISMA guidelines.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Relevance:</i> The article is highly relevant to our research on prescribing cascades. It focuses on
                identifying and understanding prescribing cascades that occur due to adverse drug reactions. It offers
                recommendations for preventing or reversing these cascades, which is crucial for our work. In detecting
                prescribing cascades, they use, among others, PSSA.<br>
            <p>
                <i>Summary:</i> 115 prescribing cascades are systematically reviewed in this article, confirming adverse
                drug reactions associated with these cascades. For 52 cascades, dose-dependency information and
                preventive strategies are given. Examples are dosage adjustments, medication discontinuation, and
                switching to alternative treatments. One example of an alternative treatment is switching to ondansetron
                for extrapyramidal syndrome caused by metoclopramide. Next to giving actionable recommendations for
                healthcare providers, it also notes the scarcity of detailed alternatives for managing these
                cascades.<br>
            <p>
                By reading and summarizing this article, I found what I have been looking for. The goal was to find an
                article that would give me examples on prescribing cascades, which I was not able to find before. The
                article also gave me an idea of extensions of our digital tool for the interdisciplinary project. At
                first, we are only giving the pharmacists a warning that a prescribing cascade has been detected,
                however we are not giving recommendations as to how they should handle the situation. With all the
                recommendations given in this article, I think it would add a lot of value in our tool to do so as well.
                However, this is surely not reachable within our time.<br><br>

            The next report to summarize is Chapter 20 from the book Clinical Epidemiology, which focuses on qualitative
            research methods in epidemiology. This will provide insights into conducting scientific interviews, a skill
            we will need for our interdisciplinary project. As we prepare for the next project meeting, where an expert
            will help guide our interview preparations, this chapter will help me understand qualitative research
            principles, particularly useful for detecting prescribing cascades and analyzing complex clinical issues in
            our study.
            <br><br><i>Authorship:</i> Chapter 20 is authored by Stephanie Thompson and Kara Schick-Makaroff, leading
            experts in clinical epidemiology, using a deep focus on integrating qualitative research methods into
            clinical settings. Their experience in the field lends authority to the content.
            <br><br><i>Credibility:</i> Being one of the chapters in the book Clinical Epidemiology: Practice and
            Methods, a reputable textbook in the field, the chapter is supported by solid research and is being
            peer-reviewed, making it a trustworthy source for understanding qualitative approaches in clinical
            epidemiology.
            <br><br><i>Relevance:</i> The reason I chose this chapter right now, is because it is highly relevant to my
            interdisciplinary project, as it explores qualitative research methodologies that can help uncover deeper
            insights into prescribing cascades. Understanding pharmacist’s decisions through qualitative methods is
            essential for addressing this complex issue in healthcare. After doing our first interview in our way, we
            talked with Lina, who is going to help us prepare scientific interviews, and she seemed not happy with the
            way we did it. As we had not done interviews before, we thought it would be good to ask questions, and
            summarize the answers. However, Lina told us that you cannot use their input when you do not have it
            literally transcribed. It was clear that we need her help, and that we need to dig more into this topic.
            Therefore, the chapter was highly relevant for me right now.
            <br><br><i>Summary:</i> The chapter explains the role qualitative research has on understanding the complex
            aspects of health, illness, and health care delivery. The authors have outlined several common approaches to
            addressing questions relating to experience and/or process that require qualitative inquiry. As with all
            types of research, clarity and specificity of the research question will inform the appropriate approach and
            facilitate good quality research. In qualitative research this includes establishing the methodology and
            consequently, the method (data collection tools). To frame the research question, it is highly important to
            ask questions like What?, Why?, and Who?, directing the researcher into the right direction. Lastly, all
            types of research require assumptions and judgement on the part of the researcher. The key to ensuring rigor
            in qualitative research is to ensure that those assumptions are consistent with the methodological approach
            and that they are made explicit. The chapter also underlines the importance of combining qualitative data
            with quantitative findings to enhance the depth of clinical research.
            <br><br>This was the first chapter I summarized from a book for my portfolio, and I found it highly relevant
            to our current work. The chapter was about 20 pages, packed with detailed information. However, I struggled
            with information overload and realized I was forgetting key points as I read. Unlike shorter articles, this
            one demanded more focus. What I liked is the summary that they gave, and some tables for visualization that
            helped me get through the chapter. I reflected on my reading habits and realized that there is room for
            improvement; choosing an informative chapter when my focus is stronger would help. I also recognize that my
            concentration today was not ideal, which made the process more challenging.

            <img src="article7.png" alt="article" style="width:40%;margin-left:15px;float:right;">
            Given the focus on scientific interviews of my interdisciplinary projects, learning more about qualitative
            methods and understanding their complexities in healthcare innovation is essential. This article stood out
            because it offers a comprehensive introduction to qualitative methods, helpful for a beginner in this area
            like me. The insights of this article are critical when introducing innovations like tools for detecting
            prescribing cascades. Our interviews, using this article’s guidance, will help bridge the gap between
            theoretical innovation and practical adoption within healthcare systems.
            <br><br><i>Authorship:</i> The article has been written by Alison B. Hamilton and Erin P. Finley, both of
            whom are well regarded in the fields of implementation science and healthcare innovation. Their work ensures
            that the article is grounded in practical experience and academic rigor, making it a valuable article for
            people working in healthcare and research.
            <br><br><i>Credibility:</i> Credibility is demonstrated by offering a detailed exploration of qualitative
            methods, a crucial aspect of implementation science. The article provides specific frameworks and examples
            for conducting high-quality research, underscoring its methodological rigor. The authors emphasize
            maintaining transparency and methodological rigor, such as purposeful sampling, thematic coding, and peer
            reviews, which are foundational practices in high quality qualitative research.
            <br><br><i>Relevance: </i>The focus of this article aligns well with the objectives of my interdisciplinary
            project from this period. As my interview coach told us, understanding the “how” and “why” behind adoption
            often influences the implementation’s challenges or successes, as mentioned in this article as well. The
            methods outlined in this article are directly applicable to evaluating the adoption of our digital tool.
            Specifically, interviews and focus groups could explore pharmacist’s perspective on medication management.
            By emphasizing qualitative approaches, the article provides strategies for addressing common barriers to
            adoption, such as resistance from healthcare providers, lack of training, or patient misconceptions. These
            insights are essential when proposing solutions for systemic issues like prescribing cascades, ensuring that
            interventions are not only evidence-based but also practical and adaptable.
            <br><br><i>Summary: </i>The article highlights the importance of qualitative methods in implementation
            research, focusing on their ability to answer complex questions about why and how healthcare interventions
            could succeed or fail. Key methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and case studies are outlined. The
            case studies capture diverse perspectives from patients and providers. Sampling strategies, suck as
            purposeful samppling, are discussed to ensure data relevance and depth.
            <br><br>To ensure research rigor, practices as thematic coding, transparency in analysis, and triangulation
            are emphasized. A case study exploring a care model for women veterans with mental health conditions
            demonstrates the real-world application of these methods, showing how they can reveal barriers, assess
            system readiness, and inform strategies implying change. Overall, the article underscores qualitative
            research’s critical role in tailoring and scaling healthcare innovations effectively.
            <br><br>I appreciated the article’s clear and structures approach, making it accessible to new interviewers.
            The practical examples, especially the case study, provided real-world context that made methods feel
            applicable and actionable. The focus on ensuring rigor through best practices, such as purposeful sampling
            and transparent analysis, was particularly helpful. However, I would have liked to see a bit more about the
            coding of an interview, as I am still confused about that.

            <h4>Article 8</h4>
            <img src="article8.png" alt="article" style="width:40%;margin-left:15px;float:right;"> Given that I will
            soon need to start coding the interviews we are conducting, I want to learn more about qualitative data
            analysis. I found this article hoping it would provide a structured approach to qualitative coding, which is
            completely new to me. Understanding how to systematically analyze interview data is crucial for extracting
            meaningful insights from our research. I hope the guidance of this article will help to ensure that our
            coding process contributes to the overall quality of our interdisciplinary project.
            <br><br><i>Authorship:</i> The article has been written by experts in computer interaction and qualitative
            research
            methodologies, ensuring that it is grounded in both academic rigor and practical experience. Their expertise
            aligns with the knowledge we need for our interdisciplinary project, where qualitative data analysis plays a
            crucial role in understanding user experiences and system adoption.
            <br><br><i>Credibility:</i> The article demonstrates credibility by providing a detailed explanation of
            coding
            techniques. The authors emphasize the importance of transparency, reflexivity, and systematic analysis in
            qualitative research. Their discussion is supported by references to established qualitative research
            methodologies, reinforcing the article’s trustworthiness.
            <br><br><i>Relevance:</i> I had hoped the article would be more relevant to my project. It surely explains
            how to
            do qualitative data analysis, but it is written more in a way where they explain what they did related to
            their research on students rather than a step-by-step guide that I will be able to use in the future.
            Overall, it is a relevant article, as it still provides a better grasp of how to do qualitative coding.
            <br><br><i>Summary: </i>A comprehensive introduction to qualitative coding is given, outlining key
            approaches such
            as thematic analysis and grounded theory. The distinction between inductive coding and deductive coding is
            explained, as well as the process of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding, offering a guide for
            organizing and refining qualitative data. The authors ensure methodological rigor by highlighting best
            practices, such as maintaining a codebook, conducting intercoder reliability checks, and refining codes
            iteratively. They discuss challenges to coding related to their research, such as managing researcher bias
            and ensuring consistency in theme identification. A case study is included to illustrate how these
            techniques can be applied in practice, showing how structured coding can reveal patterns and insights within
            qualitative datasets.
            <br><br>I see value in the style the article was written in; however, I would have liked more guidance on
            how to handle coding qualitative data in a step-by-step guide. Nonetheless, the article still provided a
            solid foundation for improving the rigor and structure of my qualitative analysis, and it helped me to
            understand the basics of qualitative data analysis more. Reflecting on this, it might actually be good that
            I picked a “wrong” article, as I wanted to deep-dive right into the steps of how to code, while it might
            have been smarter to learn something about the background and basics first. By reading through a case study
            in which qualitative coding has been done, I now have a better understanding of the thinking behind coding.

            is to summarize articles related to prescribing cascades or PSSA, I picked an article that is not related to
            either topic. I realized that the relevance of those topics is not that high during this period, so I chose
            an article related to my thesis. I hope the article that I chose will provide me with knowledge of the EU AI
            Act so I can better understand the regulation.

            valuable insights into the regulatory landscape of medical technologies equipping AI.
            <br><br><i>Credibility:</i> A comprehensive overview of the evolving regulatory frameworks for AI in medical
            technology has been provided by this article. The authors discuss the roles of key stakeholders, including
            global regulatory authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), industry trade associations,
            medical associations, and patient groups, in shaping these frameworks. The article highlights challenges
            concerning AI-enabled medical devices, such as transparency in algorithms, dataset quality, and change
            management, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory oversight to ensure effectiveness and safety.
            <br><br><i>Relevance: </i>For my thesis, which is focusing on technology regulations in MedTechs, this
            article
            offers valuable insights into the regulatory considerations of integrating AI into medical technologies.
            Understanding these regulatory paradigms helps me recognize that innovations must align with current
            standards and address potential challenges related to AI implementation in healthcare settings.
            <br><br><i>Summary:</i> Different perspectives and contributions of various stakeholders are explored in
            shaping
            the regulatory landscape of AI-enabled medical technologies. The need for a convergence of ethical,
            regulatory, technical, societal, and practical considerations in forming an effective AI regulatory
            framework is emphasized. The roles of global governance guidelines set by organizations like the WHO are
            discussed, as well as how national regulations influence this landscape. Key challenges are highlighted,
            including transparency in AI algorithms, maintaining high-quality datasets to prevent biases, and managing
            changes in adaptive AI systems. Lastly, the article underscores the importance of different stakeholders
            collaborating to address challenges and promote the safe and effective integration of AI in medical
            technology.
            <br><br>I liked the article’s structured approach to dissecting the regulatory environment of AI in MedTechs
            as it provides a clear understanding of the complexities involved. The emphasis on stakeholder collaboration
            and the identification of specific challenges, such as algorithm transparency and data quality, are
            particularly insightful. It helped me understand the regulation better so that when I start my internship
            next month, my base knowledge is broader in this topic. The next article to summarize will be about the
            NIS2, ensuring that both regulations I will be researching are covered between writing the research proposal
            and starting the internship.

                    <h4>Introduction Max Wellens – Care Manager on October 7th</h4>
                    <p>This will be an informal meeting between me and the care manager. I have planned it to learn more
                        about Maastro, his job, and to improve my communication skills with professionals. As he is one
                        of the highest within the company, I feel like he would be a good person to learn how to
                        communicate with professionals. As this will be without my laptop or any other notes, it will
                        not be a Q&A format where I will ask him questions and I write down his answers. However, I will
                        prepare by reading into him, asking some questions to coworkers about what he is like and what
                        his job is, to be prepared in my meeting with him. The questions I would like to ask Max include
                        why he is working in the healthcare sector, how he chose to join Maastro, what he thinks can be
                        improved, and what I can do for him.<br><br>
                        After my meeting I was satisfied, we talked to get to know each other and it went well. We
                        talked about him joining Maastro only halve a year ago after working at Zuyderland for most of
                        his life. The reason he switched to Maastro is because he has seven specialisms at the hospital,
                        and he started his career in radiology. To finish his career, he wanted to take it back to the
                        beginning and work at a radiology center again. He finds solutions before thinking of a problem.
                        He mentioned one aspect about digitalization he wants to focus more on, which might be
                        interesting for me. He gave me some information about it and it sounded very interesting. Now I
                        am mostly working with people within the company, however this project includes working with
                        patients and how their experiences at Maastro could be improved. I was very glad we had this
                        meeting, both because now I got to know someone who is one of the highest within the company,
                        but also because he now knows about me working here, and if he needs a student for
                        digitalization, he now knows he can reach out to me. I think this first step into enhancing my
                        communication skills will help me get new assignments later.<br>

            <h4>Introduction Jolanda Laar – Advisor of Care Manager on October 7th</h4>
            On the same day I met with care manager Max Wellens, I also scheduled a meeting with his advisor, Jolanda
            Laar. To prepare, I researched her background using Maastro's SharePoint, LinkedIn, and conversations with
            colleagues. I was told she has a strong personality but is passionate about digitalizing Maastro. During our
            meeting, she asked me to introduce myself, then she introduced herself, and then she spoke extensively—over
            an hour—about issues within the organization and areas needing improvement. While I usually talk
            considerably easy in one-on-one meetings, it was challenging to interject in this meeting. However, I
            realized many of her concerns aligned with my planned work. I anticipate working closely with her in the
            future.

                    <h4>Introduction Martine Lipsch – CIO of Maastro on October 10th </h4>
                    Before my meeting I did some research to who Martine Lipsch, the CIO of Maastro, is, and her career
                    and study history. On LinkedIn I found that she had only been working at Maastro for two years, and
                    before that she mostly worked at MUMC+. I also talked about her a little bit with some coworkers to
                    be prepared for our one-on-one meeting.
                    <br><br>The meeting was very pleasant. Martine was a friendly woman who first asked some questions
                    about me and what my reason is for joining the company. She asked to explain something more about
                    myself, non-work related and listened very interested. After I introduced myself, she told me her
                    whole story from studying until now. She is writing her PhD in Tilburg next to her job as a CIO, she
                    also told me about her children and other private topics. I was happy with how I participated in
                    this meeting. After thinking about it I realized that my communication in one-on-one meetings is
                    fine, however I am still lacking in group meetings.

            <h4>Breaks</h4>
            Even though this is not in a formal environment, I have noticed that I am quite during the breaks. Most of
            my coworkers are talking about their children, in which I find it hard to participate. I realised that I
            need to interact a bit more during informal moments, to have better connections in my career as well. When
            people ask me something, I can answer the question quite well, but I have difficulty starting a conversation
            when it is still quite. I realise that this is common during your first weeks at a new job, but I still feel
            like I need to improve on this. During the weeks I am making more progress in asking questions about for
            example their family situations and where they live, to fill my break time.<br><br>

                    to join, and even though at first the day and group was not to appealing, I decided to do it, as it
                    would improve my bond with them. I thought it would be a good opportunity to talk with them while
                    enjoying pizza and drinks. In the beginning it was a bit awkard, however I participated well during
                    the pub quiz. We finished third and it was a lot of fun. I noticed it paid of to join, as the
                    Thursday after the pubquiz, when I went to work, we had something to talk about. I felt more
                    included in the conversations now.

                    with AlphaSights. During my workshop, we were with around fifteen to twenty students and three
                    recruiters. One exercise was in couples, in which my communication is usually fine. We had to
                    negotiate on a certain case in which one student was an expert on something, and the other was an
                    associate who tried to “buy” the expert for an hour of its’ knowledge. This exercise was fun, and I
                    was quite confident in what I was doing. Later we listened to the recruiters, we did a Q&A and
                    another group exercise. My goal was to ask at least one thoughtful question during this workshop in
                    the group setting. During the presentation several people were asking questions, so I took the
                    opportunity to do so as well. It was unclear to me whether the company paid the experts or whether
                    the clients did, so my question was related to that. The answer was that the company gets a certain
                    amount of money from a client, and they can use a part of that to pay the expert. So, they are
                    incentivized to negotiate the price down. It seemed as they liked my question, as their answer was
                    quite extensive, and the students were also listening very interested.

                    <h4>Meeting Jolanda Laar – November 18th </h4>
                    One and a half months after meeting Jolanda, I find it valuable to reflect on my communication
                    skills with her. During our first meeting, I struggled to contribute as she dominated the
                    conversation, leaving little room for me to speak. In the two meetings that followed, I remained
                    hesitant but noticed gradual improvement. Although I was still apprehensive about interrupting her,
                    I became more assertive each time.
                    <br><br>Today’s meeting marked significant progress. I presented my findings from inventorying all
                    that is being done on paper across Maastro and collaborated with her on the next steps. I think in
                    this meeting, we discussed important matters and made great strides forward. While she continued to
                    lead the conversation, I ensured I voiced my thoughts when relevant. It is clear my confidence has
                    grown, and though the balance is far from equal—something colleagues say is unlikely with her—I am
                    pleased with my improvement. This experience has taught me how to navigate challenging conversations
                    and advocate for my contributions effectively.

                    <h4>Christmas at work</h4>
                    On December 12th, we had “Sinterkerst” at work. Three people bought gifts for everyone, and then we
                    did a game with a dice, changing who has which gift and the amount of gift every single round. Among
                    others, the game included exercises to take away gifts from others, but also to give gifts to
                    others. In one of my first rounds, I had to give someone an additional gift. I was the first one
                    with this assignment, and at first it felt strange to pick someone. However, throughout the game,
                    the vibes were getting better and better. Certain people were getting picked on, as everyone wanted
                    to take their gifts away as a joke, and others were being given a lot. At a time, I had six gifts
                    for myself, while some others had none. This was fun, because therefore others were picking me to
                    take away gifts. As strange as this sounds, it made me feel more like part of the group. I ended up
                    with a gift that everyone was fighting for, and even the next week, colleagues were still asking me
                    if I have given my gift a beautiful place in my room.
                    <br><br>The next day, we could sign up for a Christmas celebration, organized by the staff
                    association. I decided that I wanted to join, partly to connect better with my colleagues at I&S on
                    personal level, but also to meet new people. We started at café Charlemagne with only around 10
                    people from I&S, and 110 people from other departments. I talked with my coworkers for a bit, and
                    then I often heard my name. Most people from Maastro have not met me yet, so they were wondering who
                    the new girl at I&S is. Every time that I heard someone ask around me, I turned to them, and I
                    introduced myself. I met a lot of new people that evening, while having fun.
                    <br><br>The Sinterkerst meeting was mostly beneficial to talk easier with my coworkers at I&S. The
                    main bonus of having the Christmas celebration is that more people know me now. I feel like my work
                    at Maastro is still not challenging enough. When meeting new people and explaining what I do, people
                    know they can get in contact with me when needing help, so it will hopefully lead to me getting more
                    work.

            <h4>Meeting Frank van Thor</h4>
            <p>Every three weeks my boss plans a meeting with the two of us to discuss how everything is going,
                work-related and privately. I usually found these meetings a bit awkward, talking an hour at work about
                anything we wanted. It took me some time to get used to it, and to talk an hour straight with someone,
                sitting across from them when I get awkward when someone looks me into my eyes. Today I had one of these
                meetings again, and for the first time since I started it was not awkward. We talked about the Christmas
                party from last week, our holiday plans, and about work. He told me that he thinks I am social with my
                colleagues, and he wanted to confirm if I agree with the fact that I am really part of the team now. I
                am happy to hear that I made such progress, and that apparently my work in trying to fit in pays off. I
                am satisfied with my communication with almost everyone in one-on-one meetings now. The only thing I
                still need to work on is that I get awkward from eye contact. With most of my individual meetings you
                are looking on a computer, and then I am not bothered by this fact. However, in my meetings without
                devices this is still a point of work. For next period I will have to focus more on group meetings at
                work, as there is still some effort necessary there.</p>
            <h4>Taking the lead in a group meeting December 19th</h4>
            <p>I had scheduled a meeting with four participants, and I unexpectedly found myself in a leadership role.
                Originally, I would meet with my coworker Max and two others, in which Max would take the lead to
                discuss a plan for key users of a project. However, max was sick, and I had to step in to take over the
                meeting. The other two members suggested postponing the meeting until after Christmas when Max would be
                back, but I decided to take over the meeting and proceed without him, even though I was not fully aware
                of his exact plan.
                <br><br>At the start of the meeting, I struggled a bit as I had limited knowledge of Max’s approach, but
                I adapted quickly and guided the conversation towards meaningful outcomes. By the end of the meeting, we
                had developed a useful plan, and I was able to take away actionable points to show Max when he returns.
                I will plan a follow up meeting after the Christmas break.
                <br><br>I believe this experience was an important step in my development as a communicator, especially
                in group environments. While I still face challenges with speaking up and leading group meetings at my
                work, I was able to manage the situation effectively and demonstrated flexibility and leadership. It
                reinforced the importance of adapting when unexpected situations arise and keeping the meeting
                productive despite uncertainties.
            </p>

            <h2>Period 4</h2>
            <h4>Meeting with team leaders and CIO</h4>
            Until now, most of my meetings have been with equals or my team leader. However, today I participated in a
            meeting with two project leaders, all three team leaders of I&S, and the CIO. Initially, I anticipated
            feeling somewhat intimidated in this setting, but I was given a key role in the discussion. I had been asked
            to create an overview document outlining the necessary tasks for NEN7510 compliance, structuring it as a
            spider web per topic. During the meeting, I shared my screen to present my work, and the team provided input
            to further refine the document. I actively participated in the discussion, shared my perspectives, and
            contributed to shaping the final version.<br><br>
            I am pleased with how the meeting went, especially as it was my first time in a meeting at this level where
            I played a crucial role. However, I recognize an area for improvement: my confidence in contributing when I
            am not in control of the screen or the content being discussed. In these situations, I sometimes hesitate to
            speak up, feeling as though my input might not add value, even though I often realize that I had valuable
            insights to share. On several occasions, I have noticed that thoughts I hesitated to express were later
            brought up by others, reinforcing that my contributions are indeed relevant.<br><br>
            Moving forward, I aim to build my confidence in speaking up during discussions with team leaders and higher
            management. I have already developed comfort in meetings with equals, and I want to extend this to
            higher-level discussions so that my insights are recognized and valued. Strengthening this skill will not
            only enhance my contributions but also help establish my presence and expertise within the organization.

            <h4>Carnaval with Maastro</h4>
            The last event that I will participate before leaving Maastro is “ambtenarencarnaval”. First, a truck with
            fries will come to Maastro, and afterwards we would go towards the city. I was unsure whether I wanted to
            join or not. For the fries many people of my department would go, so I also signed up. But then, when going
            to the city, only 5 men who are much older than me would go, and no one else. I felt a bit awkward joining
            them, but they asked me to come anyways. I decided that I would join, as it will be the last chance I have
            to do something non-work related with them.<br><br>
            So after school I went to my work and we ate fries together. This was fun and not awkward at all, as we were
            with a large group. Then when going to the city center, more people from other departments also joined us,
            making it more fun then expected. We had a few drinks together, and after a few hours I left. As I reflected
            on these social activities before, I believe that it brings me benefits at work to connect with them on
            social level as well.<br><br>
            It was a fun evening, but I am not sure it brought me as much benefits as the previous social events. I
            believe that the people I was with this evening, I already have a good connection with, and at work it is
            always fun with them. I am happy that I went, and I still believe it is good to join to keep a connection
            with colleagues, but compared to the other events, I am not sure it brought me much benefit at work anymore.
            In the future when I am starting my full-time job, I plan to keep participating in social events next to
            work, as the experiences at Maastro taught me how valuable this is.

            <h2>Professional Learning Goals - Period 1</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>Goal: Build a professional network with healthcare professionals</h3>
            <h4>Project day ChipSoft September 12th </h4>
            This was my very first day at Maastro. To prepare I emailed with my boss about what the plan was on this
            day. He sent me an email with the schedule, and he thought it would be very beneficial for me to join this
            project day in order to meet some professionals. Before the project day I did not know how many people would
            be there and who would be there. During the day I did not feel like I had the ability to participate and
            talk much. Only during the break, I talked with my boss, Frank, and two women who have been working at
            Maastro for a while. I asked some questions about what they have studied, what they are doing for work now,
            and some more personal questions as well. This project day was an opening for me to meet people from my new
            job and looking back on it I talked to little with people from ChipSoft.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Project day ChipSoft October 3rd </h4>
            On this day I participated in my second project day about the implementation of ChipSoft within Maastro.
            Details about this meeting are confidential, however I can elaborate on some topics. Today Ab and Sterre
            from Chipsoft came to Maastro to help us implement their software into our system. As this is a very complex
            process, we will sit together with a combination of backgrounds within I&S (informatisering & systemen). It
            is a bit difficult for me to engage in this project day, and I notice there is a lot of improvement for me
            for my communicator learning goal in group settings to speak up. However, I did try to participate as much
            as possible and talk with them during the break.
            <br><br>With Sterre I started talking about some background in her studies. I found out she had studied in
            Amsterdam with a bachelor’s in health and Life Sciences, and did her master in Rotterdam in Health
            Economics, Policy & Law. She has had a lot of small student jobs, but for now she has been working at
            Chipsoft for almost two years. Her role is Medical Software Consultant, and she travels through the country
            to help companies implement their software. She also did interesting research about people choosing the
            optimal deductible in health insurance. What I liked about talking with her is how her career has
            transformed to where it is now, and to hear her opinion about this.
            <br><br>The second person I talked to on this day was Ab, he is a Senior Software Consultant at ChipSoft and
            has been working there since 2017. He had studied applied science in Amsterdam, with a degree in
            communication management. He had always been interested in internal communication within a company, and how
            this could improve the speed to change in a current organization. With ChipSoft he is mostly focusing on
            external communication, however, he is still working on changes within an organization and how this can be
            done as smoothly as possible. During the project day we had little time to discuss informal topics, as the
            agenda was packed. I was still glad I got a few minutes to talk to him where I learned more about his job
            and how he likes it. I think it is good to talk to people from different roles to get to know more about the
            career market.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Project day ChipSoft October 24th </h4>
            The last of three project days was on October 24th. It was the last of the three project days I would
            participate in with ChipSoft. The plan was that I could get to know new people from ChipSoft on this day,
            however as someone on their end had a concussion, the same team as last session came. Even though they were
            really nice and professional people, it disappointed me for my learning goal, as I could not meet new
            healthcare professionals in the way I planned to. However, I did my best to talk with them again and I tried
            to go a bit more into depth this time. Even though they were not new people, I am happy with the way I
            talked to them personally.

                    <h4>Maastricht Business Days November 13th</h4>
                    <p>The Maastricht Business Days (MBD) are Maastricht’s biggest recruitment event, organized by Scope
                        biannually. Scope is the study association of my previous faculty, School of Business and
                        Economics. Every edition, the event provides a steppingstone to over 600 students, by bringing
                        them in contact with around 50 renowned companies from a variety of industries. You can sign up
                        for student chats, workshops, presentations, and recruitment dinners, and the companies choose
                        whether they invite you or not. Previous editions we to orientate for me, to get to know other
                        companies, but I was not looking for something. However, this year I had one goal: to connect
                        with employees from Medtronic. </p>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <h5>Medtronic</h5>
                    The day started with a student chat with Medtronic. My goal there was to make a good impression to
                    either get myself an internship, or to already get contacts for when I want to work there later. The
                    chat was with one person from HR, and one person working in finance. First, they introduced each
                    other, then I introduced myself and then we talked about my goal at Medtronic. I told them I am
                    interested in doing my master thesis there, and mentioned they were very interested in my profile.
                    They will send my request to coworkers who are working in my field, and they gave me their contact
                    details for when it would take too long. I hope they will not take too long, as the deadline for
                    applying for thesis internships is approaching now. At least I got to connect with them, and if the
                    internship would be arranged too late, I can still use them for applying for a job in a few months.
                    I only connected with two new healthcare professionals, as I already knew the other employees from
                    two years ago when I was their company buddy at the MBDs.

                    <h5>Workshop AlphaSights</h5>
                    At first, I was not particularly interested in AlphaSights, I was not familiar with the company
                    before, so I did some research. Then I attended their workshop, and it surprised me how interesting
                    the company actually is. It would be a great company to get some experience, however, I am missing
                    the healthcare part. During the workshop we did exercises to test and improve our negotiation
                    skills, as that is the biggest skill you need at this company. Their goal is to find experts who can
                    share knowledge on topics that their client needs, where negotiating comes in handy. Unfortunately,
                    the company is not really related to healthcare or digital transformation, however, you can specify
                    and only work with the clients related to healthcare if you would want to.
                    <h5>Recruitment Dinner AlphaSights</h5>
                    Later this evening I had a recruitment dinner with the same company, in which the same three people
                    from the workshop were there, but also another recruiter. I already found out during the day that
                    their internships are for at least six months, and if you want to work there you would have to move
                    to Hamburg, London, or even outside of Europe. Therefore, during the dinner I was not aiming for
                    something. However, it was nice to clear up some questions, for example I asked how it would go if
                    you wanted to just take healthcare cases, and an employee told me that healthcare is the only sector
                    in which you can specialize. I was happy to hear that if I would consider this company, I would
                    still be able to use my MSc knowledge. I got to meet four (healthcare) professionals from
                    AlphaSights and connected with them on LinkedIn.

            <h4>Interview Kjell van der Walle November 20th </h4>
            Together with one of my groupmates, I conducted an insightful interview with Kjell van der Walle, a
            pharmacist who has been working for one year, and is currently involved in research on prescribing cascades
            himself. He studies pharmacy in Leuven and started researching prescribing cascades in March. Kjell’s plan
            is to study for hospital pharmacist next year. His involvement in this research was influenced by the work
            of the research chair, who has been investigating cascades for years.
            <br><br>Kjell told us that prescribing cascades are not widely recognized in practice, despite their
            potentially severe consequences. This phenomenon has only gained attention since the 90s, and many
            prescribers are unaware of it. Kjell emphasized the lack of awareness among healthcare professionals about
            prescribing cascades, and how important it is to make them aware through tools like the one we are
            developing.
            <br><br>He also shared valuable insights into the challenges faced by pharmacists, particularly the
            difficulty of identifying and preventing cascades during medication handouts, as pharmacists often lack
            information about the patient’s underlying condition or the reasons behind the prescribed medications. Kjell
            is very enthusiast about using a data-driven system that could help identify prescribing cascades and
            support pharmacists in medication reviews.

                </div>
                <div class="text-content"> <br><br>He also shared his thoughts on how the proposed tool could be
                    integrated into the pharmacy workflow. He highlighted the importance of clear, actionable signals,
                    such as warning about a potential cascade, that could be easily integrated into existing processes,
                    without overwhelming pharmacists with unnecessary notifications. Kjell is eager to test our
                    prototype, and he believes it could significantly help in preventing prescribing cascades in the
                    future.
                    <br><br>The interview provided me with a deeper understanding of how big the issue of prescribing
                    cascades is, and the practical challenges that pharmacists face. He helped us get a better and
                    clearer view of how our prototype should look like, and how he thinks pharmacists would or would not
                    use it. I believe that by doing this interview we created a connection to a healthcare professional
                    who might be helpful for us in the future.

                    <h4>Call with Nicolas Wery and Tim van Kemenade November 22nd - 25th </h4>
                    Due to my interest in Medtronic, I decided to connect with a healthcare professional there. Last
                    week, I discovered an intriguing department called Integrated Health Solutions (IHS) at Medtronic.
                    IHS focuses on collaborating with healthcare providers to enhance operational efficiency, improve
                    patient outcomes, and deliver value-based healthcare solutions. They aim to address challenges such
                    as workflow optimization, hospital efficiency, and tailored health services through innovative and
                    integrated approaches.
                    <br><br>To explore this further, I reached out to Nicolas Wery, a professional within the IHS
                    department, and we arranged a call. While Nicolas was very approachable and helpful during our
                    conversation, he mentioned that he could not directly assist me with securing an internship.
                    Nonetheless, he kindly provided me with the contact information of his colleague, Tim Kemenade, who
                    might be able to guide me further. I appreciated Nicolas taking the time to help, even during the
                    late afternoon, and I decided to wait until after the weekend to call Tim to respect his work-life
                    balance.
                    <br><br>Before speaking with Tim, I prepared by researching more about IHS and reviewing his career
                    background. Although my primary goal was to discuss potential internships, I also saw this as an
                    opportunity to expand my professional network within Medtronic.
                    <br><br>The call with Tim was straightforward and productive. Nicolas had already informed him about
                    my interest, so Tim was prepared for the conversation. While he explained that their department only
                    accepts interns for periods of six months or longer due to the significant time and effort required,
                    he also provided valuable insights into the work of IHS. The department focuses on long-term
                    partnerships with hospitals and healthcare providers, aiming to drive efficiency and improve care
                    delivery through strategic planning and tailored solutions.
                    <br><br>Connecting with Nicolas and Tim gave me a deeper understanding of IHS’s mission and
                    challenges. I learned that departments like IHS value long-term commitments, which has helped me
                    better understand what organizations expect from interns. While I did not secure an internship
                    opportunity, these conversations were still valuable for networking and gaining insight into how
                    innovative healthcare solutions are implemented at a corporate level. It also reinforced the
                    importance of being well-prepared and respectful when reaching out to professionals. This experience
                    has motivated me to continue building connections and exploring opportunities in healthcare
                    innovation.

                    <h4>Call ConsultAssistent</h4>
                    <p>In pursuit of wanting to find my own internship, I had a call with three professionals from
                        ConsultAssistent (CA) to create e meaningful internship and thesis project. To prepare for this
                        call I emailed with Bert Mooij, the CEO of CA, had a short call with just him to discuss what
                        the guidelines are, and I researched CA. During our conversation, we discussed my qualities,
                        skills, and potential areas of interest for my thesis research. The call allowed me to explore
                        various internship opportunities and research questions aligned with my background in HDT.
                        Although I am considering Medtronic as a potential placement, I believe it is also important to
                        explore other avenues, including the expertise and opportunities offered by CA. Medtronic and CA
                        are two far different companies, one being a large worldwide MedTech, and the other a small
                        consulting firm, both of which could teach me important experience. Niels, who was also part of
                        the meeting, could be a potential supervisor, and he told me the internship would be quite
                        technical, with doing a lot of Python. The conversation helped me broaden my perspectives and
                        refine my approach to securing an internship that aligns with my career goals and academic
                        interests.
                        <br><br>During a recent conversation, my boss, Frank van Thor, mentioned that Bert Mooij and he
                        occasionally cross paths between CA and Maastro. Frank shared that Bert was very enthusiastic
                        about how I handled our conversation and expressed hope that I would take the internship at CA.
                        This feedback affirmed my confidence in exploring different internship opportunities and further
                        refined my approach to finding the right fit.
                        <br><br>Whether I would take the internship at CA or not, it still allowed me to meet new
                        healthcare professionals and to connect with them for potential future reasons.

                    <h4>Meeting Stijn Schretlen</h4>
                    <p>As part of my ongoing search for an internship, I had a coffee meeting with Stijn Schretlen, whom
                        I got connected with by Lisanne Abrahamse, the recruiter who had previously assisted me with my
                        Medtronic application after the MBDs. Initially, Stijn was hesitant to take the conversation due
                        to a hiring freeze at his department, but Lisanne convinced him after I made a positive
                        impression during the MBD. To prepare for this meeting, I conducted additional research on HIS,
                        building upon the insights I had gathered in preparation for previous conversations with Tim and
                        Nicolas.
                        <br><br>During our meeting, I first introduced myself, shared details about my master’s program,
                        and told Stijn the requirements of our thesis internship. Subsequently, Stijn introduced
                        himself, explaining his role within Medtronic’s Integrated Health Solutions (IHS) and his
                        involvement in a startup. We discussed potential interesting research topics, both at Medtronic
                        and the startup. Stijn encouraged me to take an internship at the startup, as there is still a
                        lot of research to be done, he sees opportunities for a research thesis. However, after giving
                        it some thought, I realized that it might not be the best fit for me due to concerns about lack
                        of supervision, and little interaction with colleagues who can teach me things.
                        <br><br>Ultimately, as Stijn had anticipated, the hiring freeze prevented him from offering an
                        internship, and a few days later, he confirmed that he could not take any interns this financial
                        year. I am really sad to hear this, as Stijn sounded like a great supervisor, and we got to an
                        interesting topic. Even if this will not lead to anything, I am still glad we had coffee
                        together. Stijn told me that he had great trust in me, and what really complimented me is when
                        he said he would not be embarrassed to take me to clients, as he thinks I will be confident in
                        the job, contrary to some people working for him. If the internship at Medtronic will not work
                        out, I can always try to get in contact with Stijn again after finishing my Master, when a new
                        financial year has started. He seems like a valuable connection to have.

                    While trying to find an internship at Medtronic, I have come into contact with Gijs van der
                    Hamsvoort. I had a call with him a few weeks ago, and he told me he would try to create an
                    internship topic related to my Master. In the meantime, we have texted a few times about the
                    progress. The last time I texted him was during the last week of Christmas break, in which I
                    expected him to have holidays as well. He did not respond until the Monday after the break. I had
                    given up hope in getting an internship at Medtronic, so I emailed Bert from ConsultAssistent to plan
                    a call to discuss future progress with the internship there, as tomorrow is the first day at school
                    we will start preparing for our thesis.
                    <br><br>However, this morning Gijs responded to me that he has created an internship topic, and that
                    he is waiting on the last confirmations before he would send it to me. I asked him if he had time to
                    call, so that I could explain I would have to know the topic today, otherwise I would have to take
                    my plan B at the other company.
                    <br><br>Thus, Gijs called me, he told me about the topic, and when I mentioned I really liked the
                    topic, he gave me some more information regarding the internship rules. I am really enthusiastic
                    about the topic, and I am delighted it finally worked out. I gave up hope, but connecting with a
                    professional as Gijs eventually led to me getting an internship at my dream company.

            <h4>Future interviews</h4>
            As mentioned before, by consulting with our external coach, we made the decision to perform our interviews
            scientifically. This period, Bridget and I, have spent a lot of time learning how to conduct such
            interviews. Next period, I can work on my professional competency by conducting these interviews. We have
            created an <a href="ig.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview guide</a> to help us get
            through the interviews in an organized way. Furthermore, for the people that we will not interview in

            <h2>Period 4</h2>
            <h4>ICT&Health Conference</h4>
            During the ICT&Health conference, I had the opportunity to engage in various seminars that were relevant to
            my current job at Maastro, my future thesis at Medtronic, and topics that aligned with my master’s program
            and personal interests. The three days of seminars proved to be incredibly valuable in expanding my
            knowledge and understanding of the latest trends and technologies in health IT, digital health, and patient
            care. These experiences provided me a deeper understanding of information that I intend to incorporate into
            my future work and research.

                <div class="text-content">
                    From a technical and professional perspective, the conference helped me gain deeper insights into
                    the role of digital technologies in healthcare and their application in the field. The seminars were
                    relevant, and based on real-life scenarios. It gave more insights on how technologies are being used
                    in
                    hand-on companies, instead of learning about them in lectures. Stories of manufacturers, providers,
                    and
                    patients were included, leading to a wide range of perspectives. I learned about regulations
                    affecting daily
                    work, on how avatars can help surgeons during an operation, how healthcare has similarities to
                    aviation, and
                    how digital technologies reduce burdens for diabetics, and much more to follow.
                    <br><br>Even though I have gained a great deal of knowledge, I recognize that I could have maximized
                    the
                    value of the conference by improving my communication skills. I found that once I had an
                    introduction, I
                    could easily engage with speakers and attendees. Yet, I struggled with initiating conversations with
                    unfamiliar people and approaching speakers at stands. I hesitated before approaching them, feeling
                    unsure
                    what to ask them or what to talk about. This experience highlights an area of personal growth I need
                    to work
                    on; becoming more confident and proactive in initiating conversations in professional settings with
                    strangers. I learned that networking and communication are essential aspects of such events, not
                    only for
                    personal development, but also for expanding professional connections and enhancing the exchange of
                    ideas.

                <div class="text-content">
                    <br>During the event, I asked my father, who is experienced in going to conferences, “What do you
                    feel
                    like you learn on such days as these? Is it just to learn about experiences of the speakers, or is
                    there
                    more value in coming to these events?” He responded to me that the main value for him to go to a
                    conference
                    is learning about yourself. Learning about your communication skills and capabilities to walk up to
                    other
                    healthcare professionals and to share your thoughts. To get more confident in initiating
                    conversations with
                    strangers. And it hit me… This was the first conference I ever visited, and I lack these
                    capabilities he
                    mentioned. If this is what a conference teaches you, I have many conferences I need to visit in the
                    future
                    until I can confidentially walk up to a stand and initiate a conversation.

            </div>
            <br>In the future, I aim to improve my communication skills by preparing more effectively before
            attending similar events. I plan to research speakers and topics more extensively beforehand, so that I can
            start an introduction more prepared. Additionally, I will have to understand that speakers and attendees are
            there to share knowledge, and they often welcome discussions and questions. Before April, I will not be able
            to attend another conference. However, I feel like my biggest point of improvements in professional events
            is walking up to a stand and initiating a conversation. During the Maastricht Business Days the past few
            years, I also realized my struggle in this topic. I plan to visit the MBDs in February and only go to the
            company fair. During this fair, I must walk up to at least three stands and initiate a conversation.
            <br><br>Overall, the conference was a valuable learning experience both from a content perspective, and in
            terms of self-awareness. I realized I need to commit more into further developing my communication skills in
            such professional events, ensuring that I can fully engage in such events and maximize my learning
            opportunities.

            <h4>First Four Interviews</h4>
            As part of my interdisciplinary project, a team member and I conducted four interviews with pharmacists from
            the MUMC+ to gather insights for our research. These experiences have provided valuable lessons that will
            shape how I approach the remaining two interviews, including one with the head of the project.
            <br><br>One of the challenges I encountered during the interviews was actively keeping track of the
            responses during the conversation. While I could generally follow the discussion, I sometimes forgot what
            was said a few questions earlier, which could have been relevant for follow-up questions. This made it
            difficult to build on previous answers effectively. To address this challenge, I plan to take more notes
            during the next two interviews, capturing key points that might be useful for questions later in the
            interview.
            <br><br>What I noticed during transcribing, is my habit of saying “yes” or “ah” while the interviewee was
            speaking. I do this to show engagement, as it feels unnatural to sit silently and to only respond after the
            interviewee is done talking. However, for transcription purposes, these little words in between are not
            ideal, as they are randomly in many sentences now. A better approach for the next interviews would be to use
            non-verbal signals like nodding to show active listening without interrupting the recording.
            <br><br>Overall, the first interviews have been a learning experience, and after reflecting on them, I have
            a clearer idea of how to improve. For the next two interviews, I will focus on staying present in the
            conversation while keeping better track of responses and minimizing unnecessary verbal words. These small
            adjustments will help me conduct more structured and efficient interviews. I believe that the both of us
            have made a good impression in all four interviews, in which we were able to connect with more healthcare
            professionals. Of the four conducted so far, I believe that two connections I will never need in the future,
            but two of them might be great to stay in touch with.

                    <h4>Maastricht Business Day</h4>
                    During the ICT&Health conference I reflected on my skills to walk to a stand and talk to
                    professionals, and I realized that there is significant improvements to be made. I did not
                    participate in the MBD this period as I am not looking for jobs or internships anymore. However, I
                    decided to join the company fair to improve my skills to walk to stands and initiate a conversation.
                    The companies that were in the company fair are not companies that I want to work later, making it a
                    bit easier for me to start a conversation as I had nothing to lose. I planned to talk to at least
                    four professionals, from any company. I knew one of the recruiters of PwC, as I have done multiple
                    events with them in the past. I decided I started there to get more comfortable. I still did not
                    know what to talk about, but I went to their stand and I said to the person that I recognized “Hi,
                    you are here again” and fortunately she recognized me and we had a bit of small talk. We talked
                    about how she thought about this edition of the MBD and about my master and future internship. As I
                    already know a lot about the company and I am not interested in working there, the conversation was
                    more personal than the others. Luckily, Andrea is a really kind and enthusiastic woman, so the
                    conversation went quite easy. The hardest part for me was initiating the conversation.
                </div>
                <div style="width:30%; margin-right:5%; margin-left:5%;"><img src="mbd.jpeg" alt="Me"
                        style="width:100%;float:right;"></div>
            </div>
            <br><br>Then I still planned to go to three stands where I knew no one. I went to smaller companies, because
            then I can ask “What do you do?” or “What is your company doing?”, making it easier to initiate a
            conversation. I did this, and I met some new people. My goal was not to connect with them anywhere, just to
            improve my communication skills when it comes to professionals. I improved compared to previous encounters
            in similar situations. Compared to the conference, the MBD was easier for me to speak to as I know it is all
            recruiters looking for students, not making it weird if I initiate a conversation. I realize it also should
            not be weird on a conference, but still, it feels different to me. Furthermore, comparing it to previous
            MBD, it was now easier for me as I am a Master student and I start working in a few months. I feel like I am
            worth more now than I was at previous editions where I was just a bachelors student not looking for
            anything. I am happy with the way it went and that I am already getting more comfortable to go to a stand
            and to talk to unknown professionals. Even after working on my learning goals, I aim to keep improving on
            this on future conferences. During my future conferences, I will force myself to speak to people at stands
            there as well and to listen to others initiate conversations so that I can learn from them as to what to ask
            or what to say.

            <h4>Interview 5 and 6</h4>
            Two learning points that I realized during the first four interviews is that I have to listen more actively
            to the interviewee, and that I have to say less little words like yes or right when the other person is
            talking. Having this in mind for the last two interviews, I made significant improvements.
            <br><br>The second point is only important for transcribing the interviews, and less for my way of
            communicating with the healthcare professionals. Yet, it was still important to change. During the last two
            interviews I tried to nod more and make eye contact instead of saying yes during the answers. After
            transcribing the interviews using a digital tool, I was happy that I realized this point, as I did not have
            to delete all the small words in between the other sentences.
            <br><br>As for forgetting the answers to previous questions when asking new questions, I planned to make
            notes in between the interviews to listen more actively. Even though I feel like making notes makes the
            interview less personal as I am looking more at my computer than I did before, it did help in listening more
            actively. When I had to ask follow-up questions I was more aware of what has been previously said. I will
            keep this advice into account when performing interviews during my internship. I am happy that I improved on
            this, as it makes my appearance during an interview more professional.

            <h1> Reflection - Period 1</h1>
            <p>To reflect on period one, I will look back on the progress I made in my SMART learning goals. For each
                step taken in the learning goals, a reflection has been given in the “Progress” part. The reflection in
                this part is a general reflection.

                        <h4>Expert Competency: Enhancing Data Science and IT Skills</h4>
                        For the expert competency, the goal is to enhance my data science and IT skills. Initially, my
                        plan was to focus on this competency in the following periods. However, I found myself
                        developing these skills earlier, partly through creating this portfolio. This unplanned progress
                        helped me learn foundational python, refresh my HTML skills, and expand my knowledge in data
                        science theory. The journey felt rewarding, as I could see direct results in my progress.
                        Looking back on this period, I realize that my curiosity and enthusiasm for data science
                        motivated me to exceed my original plan. In the next period, I intend to apply these skills on
                        the interdisciplinary project among others, which will provide additional opportunities for
                        growth and practice.

                        <h4>Investigator Competency: Summarizing Articles on PSSA</h4>
                        The initial goal for this period was to summarize three articles related to PSSA, but I
                        completed only two. I realize I underestimated the time required for thorough summaries, given
                        the level of analysis needed to capture the depth of each article. Although I did not reach my
                        target, the experience taught me the importance of setting realistic timelines. I plan to
                        rectify this shortfall by dedicating more time to this goal in the next period and compensate
                        for the previous period, aiming to reach not only my initial target, but also develop a more
                        efficient approach to summarizing research material.

                        <h4>Communicator Competency: Enhance Communication Skills</h4>
                        During period one, I prioritized meeting and establishing relationships with care professionals,
                        both in formal and informal ways. Through these interactions, I have become more comfortable
                        engaging with new colleagues and feel more confident in one-on-one conversations. Reflecting on
                        these experiences, I recognize the value of building strong relationships, as it has enabled me
                        to gain insights and support from experienced individuals in my field. In the future, I hope to
                        extend this confidence in larger settings, as I believe strengthening my communication skills in
                        groups will be crucial for collaboration. To do this, I will have to set small goals for each
                        group meeting in which I would ask at least one valuable question or participate in the
                        conversation in some way.

                        <h4>Professional Competency: Engaging in Project Days</h4>
                        The last learning goal motivated me to participate in project days to build connections with
                        healthcare professionals. Participating in three project days with ChipSoft has been a valuable
                        experience, helping me to build connections and observe professional interactions. However, I
                        noticed a challenge in group settings, where I often hesitate to share my thoughts, likely out
                        of self-doubt or fear of interrupting others. This hesitation has often limited my ability to
                        contribute more effectively. Moving forward, I plan to work on this by setting small personal
                        goals for each meeting, related to the communicator learning goal. Additionally, I aim to
                        observe skilled communicators and adopt their techniques to improve my own engagement. I am
                        hopeful that these steps will help me feel more confident and better equipped to participate
                        actively in group discussions, thus leave a better impression during project days. I believe
                        that it is essential to work on the communicator learning goal, to improve my progress in the
                        professional competency.

            <h1> Reflection - Period 2</h1>
            In Period 2, I made significant strides across my four key competencies: Expert, Investigator, Communicator,
            and Professional. Each area presented unique challenges and opportunities for growth, which I navigated with
            persistence and strategic planning.

                        <h4>Expert Competency:</h4>
                        My primary focus this period was on improving my data science and programming skills. Through
                        practical experience and external guidance, I made tangible progress in programming,
                        particularly while working on my portfolio and interdisciplinary project. Transitioning to tools
                        like Visual Studio and GitHub was a turning point, enabling more efficient workflows and better
                        version control. While challenges like formatting issues in coding persisted, seeking mentorship
                        from colleagues like Hubert Bessems helped me gain valuable insights into debugging and
                        time-saving techniques. Additionally, courses like Computational Thinking enhanced my
                        understanding of problem-solving, although I noted a gap between theoretical learning and
                        immediate project applications. This period reinforced the importance of balancing independent
                        learning with collaborative support to build technical skills effectively.

                        <h4>Investigator Competency:</h4>
                        In this competency, I focused on summarizing and critically analyzing academic literature
                        relevant to prescribing cascades. I reviewed a diverse range of articles, with some offering
                        valuable insights into methodologies like Prescription Sequence Symmetry Analysis (PSSA).
                        However, I encountered instances where articles lacked the relevance I initially anticipated.
                        This underlined the importance to adapt my learning goal slightly, also allowing to summarize
                        articles related to interviewing methodologies. Changing my article selection process allowed me
                        to be more strategic in aligning resources with project objectives of all periods. The lessons
                        learned here have been pivotal in improving my research efficiency and aligning my summaries
                        with project deliverables. Reflecting on how I created this initial learning goal, the goal
                        lacked relevance for period 2 and 4.

                        <h4>Communicator Competency:</h4>
                        Developing confidence in professional interactions was a central goal this period, and I
                        observed clear progress, especially in one-on-one settings. Meetings with colleagues like
                        Jolanda Laar and Martine Lipsch provided valuable opportunities to practice assertiveness and
                        active listening. I took proactive steps to participate in group activities such as workshops
                        and social events, which enhanced my sense of belonging within the workplace. A particular
                        highlight was taking the lead in an unexpected meeting, which pushed me out of my comfort zone
                        but allowed me to demonstrate adaptability and leadership. While I feel more comfortable in
                        smaller settings, group environments remain a focus for future growth, especially in maintaining
                        confidence during moments of unexpected responsibility.

                        <h4>Professional Competency:</h4>
                        Building a professional network within the healthcare sector was a major focus in Period 2.
                        Events like the Maastricht Business Days and meetings with professionals from Medtronic and
                        ConsultAssistent broadened my understanding of potential career paths. While not all
                        conversations directly resulted in opportunities, they were instrumental in expanding my network
                        and refining my approach to professional communication. The eventual success in securing an
                        internship at Medtronic was a testament to the value of persistence and strategic networking.
                        Additionally, conducting interviews with pharmacists provided deeper insights into the practical
                        challenges of prescribing cascades and strengthened my ability to engage with experts
                        effectively.</p>

                    One point of feedback after period 1 is to make a logbook with dates that I worked on my goals. At
                    first, I created a table in word with the topic, date, and competency. However, I wanted to
                    visualize it better, so I created a Canva road in which you can vertically see all the progress I
                    have made, each competency having its own color. Reflecting on this, I should have done this in the
                    first period already. To make a logbook is great for seeing progress, however making it the way I
                    did in Canva is eye opening. By looking at the colors you see exactly in which competency you are
                    still lacking to put effort in that period. For example, halfway through the period I saw I was
                    missing some blue in my logbook, showing that I have spent to little time on my expert competency.
                    The final goal was to have all colors approximately be there the same amount. I would recommend
                    other students to also create a logbook and include colors in this.

            <h4>Overall Reflection:</h4>
            Period 2 was a transformative phase, marked by incremental but meaningful progress across all competencies.
            By actively seeking feedback, embracing challenges, and leveraging external resources, I gained valuable
            insights into my strengths and areas for improvement. In the beginning of this period, I struggled with our
            coach being on holidays right after we received written feedback on the portfolio of period one. Some of the
            feedback I did not understand, and I could not ask for clarification as our substitute coach did not want to
            put us on wrong tracks. I hope that even though I am not sure if what I am doing is desired, I still manage
            to do what I am supposed to do. Moving forward, I aim to build on this foundation by addressing gaps,
            particularly in group communication and strategic article selection, while continuing to enhance my
            technical and professional expertise. During my last coach meeting we set up weakly goals, I like that this
            gave me a schedule to hold on to, and I am satisfied with the way I kept to my plan. Likewise, I have come
            up with more proof this period than the previous one, so I can see my portfolio improving overtime.
            <br><br>For the next period, a large part of my focus will be aimed at the professional competency. I will
            conduct scientific interviews, and I will go to my first conference, the Health ICT conference in the MECC.
            Furthermore, I will have to find relevant topics to summarize for my investigator competency, improve my
            data science techniques by participating in the technical part of our interdisciplinary project, and I hope
            to be more relevant and seen at work.
